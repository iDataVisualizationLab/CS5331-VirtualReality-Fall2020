The player would be playing the role of a villain who has to contaminate the river as much as possible without alerting the authorities or getting an uprising from its citizens. The river gets polluted by the construction of building such as factories, farmlands, etc. The game would be constructed this way so the players are encourage to see the different harmful effects that come from different structures and processes.

Natural disasters and destruction will be randomly triggered as leveling progresses; some of these caused by pollution, such as acid rain. All buildings can contribute to increasing pollution, but some will decrease pollution - such as water treatment plants.

For example, the player would first be taught on level one, in great detail, exactly how the hydrologic cycle takes place. As there are variations in this process for different types of terrains and water bodies (aqueducts vs. lakes vs. oceans vs. areas with minimal thermal exposure), the player would be challenged to figure out what the optimal method of beginning the cycle and following the process to ensure that all parts of the cycle are going on.
