A player enters each level outside of a building, with a mask on and fully sanitized. Once the game starts, the player has to navigate through a map to reach entrance of another building. As the player progresses through the level, they have to dodge various particles of viruses in the air (whose occurrence depends on how populous the environment is). In case they encounter a virus once, they lose their mask. When they encounter the virus again, they lose health points and eventually get infected (loose the game). The player can find sanitizer stations and masks along the way at a few places to restock and replenish their health. The end goal is for the player to reach the finish point with a mask on and with a threshold health level.",

One player is the maze runner who traverses the maze in a VR world. The other player is a teammate with a navigational map that helps the maze runner escape the labyrinth using hints and clues that the navigator gets using his information map. This two-person puzzle brings a new look to escape games everywhere. This game is not designed to take a long time to complete but instead focuses on teamwork and improving critical thinking. We expect players to take no longer than 10-20 minutes to complete the game using our current design.,
