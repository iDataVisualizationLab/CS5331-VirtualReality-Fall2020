The user will be able to place buildings wherever they see fit and depending on these locations the game will give them a score based on how efficient their system is. Players will have the ability to create any city area they desire as we have a large catalog of city infrastructure and buildings to work with. The game will feature three varying modes ranging from easy to hard. Easy mode will consist of abundant resources while hard modes will have you thinking how to use your limited sources.

We expect players to take no longer than 10-20 minutes to complete the game using our current design.

A player enters each level outside of a building, with a mask on and fully sanitized. Once the game starts, the player has to navigate through a map to reach entrance of another building. As the player progresses through the level, they have to dodge various particles of viruses in the air (whose occurrence depends on how populous the environment is). In case they encounter a virus once, they lose their mask. When they encounter the virus again, they lose health points and eventually get infected (loose the game). The player can find sanitizer stations and masks along the way at a few places to restock and replenish their health. The end goal is for the player to reach the finish point with a mask on and with a threshold health level."
